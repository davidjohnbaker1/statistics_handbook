Overview of Introduction to R
========================================================

- Rationale Behind R and writing scripts/code
- R as Calculator 
- Data Structures
- Manipulating Data
- Tons of Functions 
- Whirlwind R Tour 

Goal Of Session
========================================================

- Learn Basics of R and RStudio
- Practice concepts with simple examples
- Familiarize with vast array of functions
- Have vocabulary and "R" way to think about problem solving


Rationale
========================================================

- Easily reproducible
- Less Human Error in cleaning
- Time invested in programming transfers
- Pretty Graphs
- Open Science 
- Huge integration 


R as Calculator
========================================================

The Console of R is where all the action happens.
You can use it just like you would use a calculator.
Try to do some basic math operations in it. 

- Addition/Subtraction
- Multiplication/Division
- Square roots
- Logical < , >, ==, !=

Making Objects I
========================================================

You don't always want to print your output and retype it in.
Idea is to be very lazy (efficient).
- Save some math to an object with the <- operator, then manipulate that.

```{r}
foo <- 2 * 3
foo * 6
```


Making Objects II
========================================================

Notice what has popped up in your environment in RStudio!

Let's get more efficient.

```{r}
yearsInGradSchool <- c(2,1,4,5,6,7,3,2,4,5,3)
```


Making Objects III
========================================================

```{r}
yearsInGradSchool * 3
yearsInGradSchool - 2
```

Making Objects IV
========================================================

```{r}
yearsInGradSchool < 2
```


Exploring I
========================================================

```{r}
mean(yearsInGradSchool)
sd(yearsInGradSchool)
```

Exploring II
========================================================

```{r}
mean(yearsInGradSchool)
sd(yearsInGradSchool)
```

Exploring III
========================================================
What happens when you use ...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hist(yearsInGradSchool)
scale(yearsInGradSchool)
range(yearsInGradSchool)
min(yearsInGradSchool)
class(yearsInGradSchool)
str(yearsInGradSchool)
summary(yearsInGradSchool)
```

Two Objects I
========================================================

```{r}
yearsInGradSchool <- c(2,1,4,5,6,7,3,2,4,5,3)
classesTaken <- c(5,2,5,7,9,9,2,8,4,7,2)
```

We then pass to a function two arguments, can get auto complete with TAB
```{r}
cor(yearsInGradSchool,classesTaken)
```

Two Objects II
========================================================

- How do you think you would make this **plot**?
- Can you add any arguments to change the axes and the titles?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(yearsInGradSchool,classesTaken)
```

Iris Data set I
========================================================

- Most common 'practice' data set is the iris data set
- Already preloaded in R
- Try to explore with commands we have used thus far...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(iris)
class(iris)
summary(iris)
```


Iris Dataset II
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
str(iris) 
```

Iris Dataset III
========================================================

Accessing individual 'columns' is done with the $ operator

```{r, eval=FALSE}
iris$Sepal.Length
```

Can you use this to plot the different numeric values against each other?

Iris Dataset IV
========================================================

What would the follow commands do? 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hist(scale(iris$Sepal.Length))


iris$Sepal.Length.scale <- scale(iris$Sepal.Length)
```


Indexing 
========================================================

Let's combine logical indexing with creating new objects.

What do the follow commands do? Why?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
iris[1,1]
iris[2,]
iris[,5]
iris[Sepal.Length < 5,]
iris[,c(1:4)]
iris[c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8),c(1:3,5)]
Setosas <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa",]
```

**This could be an entire lecture by itself!!!**

Whirlwind R Tour 
========================================================

- R's power comes in the fact that you download packages to put on top of base R

Packages for 
- Turning Data tables into already formatted APA Latex Tables (stargazer, xtable)
- Creating Publication Quality Graphs (ggplot2)
- Exploring data and not making chart after chart after chart (psych)
- Every statistical test you could want (psych, cars, ezanova, lavaan)
- Software to plot not so normal output (SEMplots)
- Making Websites in R
- These slides were written in R
- Quickly processing huge datasets (data.table, dplyr)
- Tons of Machine Learning

Whirlwind R Tour  
========================================================

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, 
                 color = Species), 
       xlab = "Sepal Length",
       ylab = "Sepal Width",
       main = "My Plot") + geom_point()
```

Whirlwind R Tour  
========================================================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(iris, lm = TRUE)
```



Whirlwind R Tour
========================================================

- nlme() and lme4() for Multilevel Modeling 
- lavaan() for Latent Variable Analysis
- ezAnova() for ANOVA based testing; the anova() function does model comparisons
- profileR for Repeated Measures MANOVA
- glm() and lm() for linear models
- caret() for Machine Learning
