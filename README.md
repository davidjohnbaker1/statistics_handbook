## Statistics, R, Music Cognition

This is a very early stage repo dedicated to creating a handbook for researchers of any level interested in learning more about statistics and the R language.
Material from the book stems primarily from Jason Hicks' 4111 Intermediate Statistics class at LSU, as well as other sources I have encountered the past few years.

The main idea is to have a handbook for anyone interested in doing quantitative research that does not have sciecnes background.
Most of the examples will be relevant to either music psychology, computational musicology, or issues relating to arts managment. 
The entire book is written in R.
